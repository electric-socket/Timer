I wanted to time an event in a batch file, come back to it later, and see how long the activity took. Using the command  
`TIME <NUL >>RESULT.TXT `  
before and after was doable, but clumsy. It also doesn't show elapsed time, I have to figure it. So I decided I needed a timer program, 
and it shouldn't be too hard to do (famous last words). By the time I got finished, it had takem two days. (Maybe I should have seen if 
there already is one. Then again, if everyone does that, nothing new would be created.) But anyway, here it is.  

If there are no files present, it means I haven't uploaded it yet
